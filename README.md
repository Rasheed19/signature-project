# signature-project
This repository contains the codes for all the experiments performed in the paper _'Early prediction of Remaining Useful Life for Lithium-ion cells using only signatures of voltage curves at 4 minute sampling rates.'_

To run the codes, create a folder named **data**. Download the following data and put them in this folder:

 - all the batches of data in this link https://data.matr.io/1/ which are the data for the papers [Data driven prediciton of battery cycle life before capacity degradation by K.A. Severson, P.M. Attia, et al](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-019-0356-8) and [Attia, P.M., Grover, A., Jin, N. et al. Closed-loop optimization of fast-charging protocols for batteries with machine learning. Nature 578, 397â€“402 (2020).](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-1994-5). 
 
 - the internal resistance data used to complement batch 8 can be downloaded from https://doi.org/10.7488/ds/2957 which is published in the paper [Strange, Calum; dos Reis, Goncalo. (2020). Synthetic IR data for the Attia et al. (2020) battery dataset, [dataset]. University of Edinburgh. School of Mathematics. https://doi.org/10.7488/ds/2957.](https://doi.org/10.7488/ds/2957).

Create a folders named **plots** and **models** to store the generated figures and models respectively.

The **utils** folder contains all the helper functions used in the **Jupyter notebooks**.
